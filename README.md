# Dingus Kart - 3D Printable Game Boy Cartridge Shell

Welcome to the Dingus Kart project! This repository contains a 3D printable model of a Game Boy cartridge shell and a Photoshop template for creating custom cartridge labels. This project is perfect for retro gaming enthusiasts looking to create custom cartridges for their Game Boy collection!

## Contents

- **dingus-kart_FRONT.stl**: 3D model for the front part of the Game Boy cartridge shell.
- **dingus-kart_BACK.stl**: 3D model for the back part of the Game Boy cartridge shell.
- **dingus-kart_label-template.psd**: Photoshop template for creating custom cartridge labels.

## How to Use

### 3D Printing Instructions

**Important Note**: The 3D models are not FDM-printing friendly. Due to the thin walls in certain parts of the design, FDM printing is not recommended. The models have only been tested with SLS printing, which provides better results for this specific design.

1. Download both the `dingus-kart_FRONT.stl` and `dingus-kart_BACK.stl` files.
2. Load the STL files into your preferred 3D printing software.
3. Configure your printer settings based on your specific printer's requirements, preferably an SLS printer.
4. Print both the front and back parts of the cartridge shell. 
5. Once printed, the two halves can be assembled to form a complete Game Boy cartridge shell.

### Label Customization

1. Open the `dingus-kart_label-template.psd` in Adobe Photoshop or any compatible software.
2. **Font Requirement**: The PSD file uses the font "Univers Condensed," which is not included due to licensing restrictions. This font is often included in Windows and Windows-related products. If you do not have access to "Univers Condensed," you can use the Google Font "Oswald Bold" as a close alternative.
3. Customize the template with your own design, game title, or artwork.
4. **Corner Cutting**: The corners of the label template are designed to be cut at a 2mm radius. Ensure you cut the corners at 2mm for a precise fit on the cartridge shell.
5. Print the label on adhesive paper and cut it to the proper dimensions.
6. Apply the custom label to your 3D printed cartridge shell.
